                                    introduce students to CS. Along with preparing them, I have brought many members to attend in-person competitions and hackathons as well.

                                    In 2023 I tutored a few elementary school students individually and on a weekly basis. I prepared lessons in <u>Scratch</u> or <u>Python</u> and 
                                    always had a concise lesson plan that I updated parents' with.
