# My website
My first website :) I have pretty basic experience in HTML/CSS and I'm really hoping to learn a lot. Very excited to work on this project.

11/18/23 - First page 'finished'
Very satisfied and happy with the current outcome :) Set a bunch of future goals for the website that I will hopefully be slowly furfilling over time.
