# My website
My first website :) I have pretty basic experience in HTML/CSS and I'm really hoping to learn a lot. Very excited to work on this project.

11/18/23 - First page 'finished'
Very satisfied and happy with the current outcome :) Set a bunch of future goals for the website that I will hopefully be slowly furfilling over time.

11/23/23 - Mobile ui
Very lazy solution of just lowering font sizes and removing images but it's not ugly if i open it on my phone sooooo

12/31/23 - Portfolio page finished
Not linked with the original page though. Made with a template because I'm trying to get it done in a short amount of time. Will eventually try to handcode. 

6/16/24 - Re-updated Homepage
Re updated with all my CS experience and contact links.
