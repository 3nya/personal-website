# My website
My first website :) I have pretty basic experience in HTML/CSS and I'm really hoping to learn a lot. Very excited to work on this project.

11/18/23 - First page 'finished'
Very satisfied and happy with the current outcome :) Set a bunch of future goals for the website that I will hopefully be slowly furfilling over time.

11/23/23 - Mobile ui
Very lazy solution of just lowering font sizes and removing images but it's not ugly if i open it on my phone sooooo

Problems/goals:
- Code didn't build properly so the images don't get removed when the screen width is low (works locally)
- Going to update contents and link it to portfolio page which is in progress
