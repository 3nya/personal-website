								The light creates a beautiful radiance, showering the girl in a effulgent glow.

							<h6> <i> I had originally made this piece with watercolor, trying to make the girl appear more delicate and light. 
								However, I realized that to make the highlights and glow, there had to be contrast in the background, which caused
								my change to gouache. The hair and highlights are layered with thick, pigmented goache, but most of the skin is still 
								the original watercolor.

							<h6> <i>My second time using goache, and I really loved it. I love how you can retain the consistency of acryilc paints,
								 	while still being able to obtain the lightness of watercolor. The goache really allowed me to continue layering and 
									paint the abundant petals, grass, and leaves scattered across the page.</i></h6>

						<h6> <i>I always strayed away from using watercolor. Not a big fan of it's layering style and always leaned
								towards the thicker paints. But the nature behind watercolor's faint style really stood out to me before
								painting this piece. Watercolor's layering technique is unique: being that you have to be very paitent and plan
								your initial colors behind your main colors. The layers are light, but accumulate, creating beautiful
								finishes that convey depth through it's hues.

						<h6> <i> I actually don't totally love the result of this painting. I really loved the idea, and was very excited
							towards painting the swing, moon, and layering the petals, plants, and candles. However, the plants on the bottom
							look rather messy to me now, and I don't like how the light works in the painting. Could have been avoided
							with better planning, but nevertheless a lot was learned.

							<h3> Enya Chen (she/her)
							</h3>
							
							<p>
								I've been drawing since I was 4 years old, and was almost completely convinced 
								I would do art in my future until 8th grade. This was around the time when I started
								playing around with Arduino with my family friends, becoming very interested in its hardware
								and trying to learn how to code.
								
							</p>
							<p>
								Despite stopping Arduino in 9th grade, I still kept coding. I placed my skills into coding competitions (
								such as <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php">USACO</a>, <a href="https://codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a>, 
								and trying to attend any local competitions/hackathons whenever possible), and VEX Robotics where I mainly did documenting,
								but worked on autonomous programming every now and then.
								
								Nowadays, I have not been working as much on improving my own coding skills, but others instead through HHS Coding Club, 
								where I make presentations and lessons every week. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
								You can find some of my solutions and projects to come on my <a href="https://github.com/3nya">GitHub profile</a>.
							</p>

							<br>
							<p>
								Outside of coding, I love watching movies, listening to music, and trying new makeup looks.
								I primarily listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/IcowtOtJ3Ls?si=LJygiwMDIENQssO8">古风</a>, 
								<a href="https://youtu.be/0wGJBU57Ax8?si=e27MJDJpKzTpl5fR">K-pop</a>, 
								<a href="https://youtu.be/9zezWJQpcJM?si=tkpmgfLxvkJlYNu2">Electric guitars</a>, 
								<a href="https://youtu.be/jMKPYg0uhCI?si=nMJk9XVjJtAymE9n">Vocaloid</a>, and 
								<a href="https://youtu.be/uWdHM3-2cpU?si=WZgEaytXRNHTM38Y">rap</a>, but I like most pop songs played 
								on the radio (all links above are YouTube links, however I don't actually use YouTube to listen to music,
								and have 30,000-56,000 mins listened on Spotify per year for the past 4 years).
